# A Golang primer

To make the most out of this library, it's essential to have a solid understanding of Go's capabilities. Familiarity with certain language and standard library features is crucial for achieving this goal.

It is out of scope of this document to provide a complete Go tutorial, it is expected that you have some familiarity already or have other means to cover that requirement.

This document aims to bring your attention to key aspects only.

## Functions

Functions in Go have a key part in the language design philosophy:

- Can return multiple values.
- Are first-class citizens (in short, they are treated as any other data type, thus assignable to a variable).
- Can be defined as closures, thus capturing surrounding declared variables that can be accessed and modified even after the surrounding function returned.
- Variable number of arguments with the ellipsis syntax (`...`).
- Return values can be named

### Coroutines

Coroutines (aka goroutines) are lightweight threads of execution, managed by the Go runtime instead of the OS.
Therefore, concurrent programming is natively supported. Communication is commonly achieved with `channels`.

Take the following naive example:
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func foo() {
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        fmt.Println("foo", i)
        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    }
}

func bar() {
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        fmt.Println("bar", i)
        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    }
}

func main() {
    // Start the goroutines in parallel
    go foo()
    go bar()

    // Naive approach for awaiting the goroutines to finish
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)

    fmt.Println("Done")
}
```

The functions `foo` and `bar` are executed in parallel, just by utilising the native language `go` statement.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that using a `time.Sleep`, to assume that both functions had enough time to complete, is an improper way of solving the problem.
> The idea is to avoid including other concepts simultaneously.

### Closures

Combined with the fact that functions in Go are first-class citizens, closures are a language feature that bring a lot of power and flexibility.
With such capability, it becomes possible to create functions that capture and maintain a state, behave like objects, facilitate functional and concurrency logic.

Take the following example, that defines a simple sequencer:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func sequencer() func() int {
    i := 0
    return func () int {
        i++
        return i
    }
}

func main() {
    seq1 := sequencer()

    fmt.Println(seq1()) // prints 1
    fmt.Println(seq1()) // prints 2
    fmt.Println(seq1()) // prints 3

    seq2 := sequencer()
    fmt.Println(seq2()) // prints 1
}
```

With this library you will often be leveraging from this language feature, by passing anonymous functions over. Such approach will require to follow a certain signature but will simplify integrating your code seamlessly without too much boilerplate or obscure code.

### Defer

The `defer` statement in Go allows you to schedule a function call to be executed later, when the surrounding function completes. It is often used to ensure that some cleanup code is executed after a function completes, regardless of the path that led to the function's exit.

Take this revised example where the `defer` statement is utilised to signal the wait group the function completed its execution:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "time"
)

func foo(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done()
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        fmt.Println("Foo:", i)
        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    }
}

func bar(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done()
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        fmt.Println("Bar:", i)
        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    }
}

func main() {
    // Define a wait group...
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    // ... with 2 slots
    wg.Add(2)
    
    // Start the operations in parallel
    go foo(&wg)
    go bar(&wg)
    
    // Wait for completion
    wg.Wait()
    
    fmt.Println("Done!")
}
```

This example is too simple to show the real value of using `defer`, but it tries to illustrate it's purpose. With this mechanism you can be rest assured that, when the function terminates, the statement will always be executed. A more complex execution pattern, with multiple return points, would show off better the value of this statement (since you would not be hard-pressed, to make sure in each return block, the wait group is signalled properly).

## Wait Groups

Wait Groups are a mechanism to allow any other goroutine to wait for a group of goroutines to complete before continuing execution.

Take this revised example, where the parallel execution of `foo` and `bar` is awaited using this construct:
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "time"
)

func foo(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        fmt.Println("Foo:", i)
        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    }
    wg.Done()
}

func bar(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        fmt.Println("Bar:", i)
        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    }
    wg.Done()
}

func main() {
    // Define a wait group...
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    // ... with 2 slots
    wg.Add(2)
    
    // Start the operations in parallel
    go foo(&wg)
    go bar(&wg)
    
    // Wait for completion
    wg.Wait()
    
    fmt.Println("Done!")
}
```

You will not likely be often required to rely on Wait Groups interacting with this library. Most of the constructs make your life easier with concurrency or by communicating between them, even if running in the background or in parallel.

One use case, however, is if you want to be sure that when publishing an event, into the `eventhub.EventHub` construct, all subscribers got the chance to execute until completion.

> üëâ Normally you just fire and forget events, this is just meant for special scenarios where you need to be sure everything finished before continuing.

e.g.:
```go
func main(){
    ...
    wg := hub.Publish(SomeEvent{}, nil)

    // Wait for all subscribers to complete their execution
    wg.Wait()
}
```

## Channels

Channels are thread-safe data structures for communicating between goroutines.

Take the following revised example:
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "time"
)

func foo(ch chan<- bool) {
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        fmt.Println("Foo:", i)
        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    }
    ch <- true
}

func bar(ch chan<- bool) {
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        fmt.Println("Bar:", i)
        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    }
    ch <- true
}

func main() {
    // Define a channel
    ch := make(chan bool)
    
    // Start the operations in parallel
    go foo(ch)
    go bar(ch)
    
    // Wait for completion
    <-ch
    <-ch
    
    fmt.Println("Done!")
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This would not be the proper way to solve the problem (actually the Wait Group example would be the more appropriate way). This is just meant to demonstrate the usage of a channel.

This library will likely prevent you to often need to utilise `channels`. It is key, however, to understand this mechanism and its important role on implementing synchronisation. 

### More on channels

Take the following naive example to compute values in parallel, using a channel to communicate back the result:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

func main() {
    // a wait group to wait for all results
    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    // a channel to pass by resuld
    ch := make(chan int)

    // launch 5 goroutines for calculating the square route of a number
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        wg.Add(1) // inform the wait group we have one more execution to await for
        go func(n int) {
            ch <- n * n // send the squared value of n through the channel
            wg.Done() // signal that this goroutine is done
        }(i)
    }

    // wait, in the background, for all calculations to finish before closing the channel
    go func() {
        wg.Wait() // wait for all goroutines to finish
        close(ch) // close the channel
    }()

    // print results
    for val := range ch {
        fmt.Println(val)
    }
}
```

Though still academic, this example should give you a better understanding about the role of channel and of a Wait Group. 

### Switch case statement on steroids

In Go, the switch statement is a versatile control structure, with unique features that familiarity with other languages might leave  one at loss when having a first contact. The keyword is `select` and this is the least odd difference one might spot.

Take the following example, many other languages offer equivalent behavior:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    name := "Gopher"
    switch name {
    case "Gopher":
        fmt.Println("Hello, Gopher!")
    case "World":
        fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
    default:
        fmt.Println("Hello, stranger!")
    }
}
```

What makes Go special is the capability of dealing with channels, so this statement is crucial to work with such data structures.

Take the following example:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	ch1 := make(chan string)
	ch2 := make(chan int)
	ch3 := make(chan bool)

	go func() {
		defer close(ch1)
		ch1 <- "Hello"
	}()

	go func() {
		defer close(ch2)
		ch2 <- 42
	}()

	ch1Closed := false
	ch2Closed := false

	defer close(ch3)

	// when the count reach 0, cancel the context
	go func() {
		for {
			if ch1Closed && ch2Closed {
				break
			}
		}

		ch3 <- true
	}()

	for {
		select {
		case msg, ok1 := <-ch1:
			if ok1 {
				fmt.Println("Received number from ch1:", msg)
			} else {
				fmt.Println("Channel 1 closed")
				ch1Closed = true
			}
		case num, ok2 := <-ch2:
			if ok2 {
				fmt.Println("Received number from ch2:", num)
			} else {
				fmt.Println("Channel 2 closed")
				ch2Closed = true
			}
		case <-ch3:
			fmt.Println("All channels closed")
			return
		}
	}
}
```

In a nutshell, the previous example uses two channels to send messages and when both are closed we send another message to stop the execution.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice how it can be verified when a channel becomes closed and how he are using it to toggle the flags.
> 
> One might consider using a counter, keeping track of the open channels, when reaching 0 it could be utilised to signal termination. You might be surprised that the messages stating that a channel got called can be called multiple times.
> Be aware of this behavior!
> 
> Also, please understand this is just for illustrating purposes, it would not be a good implementation of a Parallel Aggregation pattern, neither the proper way to deal with cancellation.

## Context

### Cancellation

üöß

Take the following example:
```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    ch1 := make(chan string)
    ch2 := make(chan int)

    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
    defer cancel()

    go func() {
        defer close(ch1)
        ch1 <- "Hello"
    }()

    go func() {
        defer close(ch2)
        ch2 <- 42
    }()

    count := 2

    // when the count reach 0, cancel the context
    go func() {
        for {
            if count == 0 {
                break
            }
        }
        cancel()
    }()

    for {
        select {
        case msg, ok := <-ch1:
            if ok {
                fmt.Println("Received number from ch1:", msg)
            } else {
                count--
            }
        case num, ok := <-ch2:
            if ok {
                fmt.Println("Received number from ch2:", num)
            } else {
                count--
            }
        case <-ctx.Done():
            fmt.Println("All channels closed")
            return
        }
    }
}
```

In a nutshell, the previous example uses two channels to send messages and when both are closed we issue a cancellation on a context that it is then utilised to stop the execution.
